Fake currency Detection with Machine Learning and Image Processing
Fake currency detection systems use image processing and machine learning algorithms to analyze features like watermarks, security threads, and alignment. Some say K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is the most accurate algorithm for small datasets and correctly identified all genuine notes in one study.
